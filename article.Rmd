I am interested in exploring data related to the Covid 19 Pandemic and the efficacy of Pharmaceutical and Non-Pharmaceutical interventions (lock downs, contact tracing etc.) in controlling the spread of the virus globally. I want to compare the effectiveness of these across different social groups by using categories like gender, country etc. 

I am also interested in exploring data related to the Covid 19 Pandemic and the how that has impacted Gender equity, especially domestic violence against women in different countries.
